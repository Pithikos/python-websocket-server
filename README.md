Websocket Server
=======================

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/Pithikos/python-websocket-server/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/Pithikos/python-websocket-server/tree/master) [![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/websocket-server.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/websocket-server)

A minimal Websockets Server in Python with no external dependencies.

  * Python3.6+
  * Clean simple API
  * Multiple clients
  * No dependencies

Notice this project is focused mainly on making it easy to run a websocket server for prototyping, testing or for making a GUI for your application. Thus not all possible features of Websockets are supported.


Installation
=======================

Install with pip

    pip install websocket-server

For coding details have a look at the [*server.py*](https://github.com/Pithikos/python-websocket-server/blob/master/server.py) example and the [API](https://github.com/Pithikos/python-websocket-server#api).


Usage
=======================
You can get a feel of how to use the websocket server by running

    python server.py

Then just open `client.html` in your browser and you should be able to send and receive messages.


Testing
=======

Run all tests

    pytest


API
=======================

The API is simply methods and properties of the `WebsocketServer` class.

## WebsocketServer

The WebsocketServer can be initialized with the below parameters.

*`port`* - The port clients will need to connect to.

*`host`* - By default the `127.0.0.1` is used which allows connections only from the current machine. If you wish to allow all network machines to connect, you need to pass `0.0.0.0` as hostname.

*`loglevel`* - logging level to print. By default WARNING is used. You can use `logging.DEBUG` or `logging.INFO` for more verbose output.

*`key`* - If using SSL, this is the path to the key.  

*`cert`* - If using SSL, this is the path to the certificate.


### Properties

| Property | Description          |
|----------|----------------------|
| clients  | A list of `client`   |


### Methods

| Method                      | Description                                                                           | Takes           | Gives |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-------|
| `run_forever()`       | Runs server until shutdown_gracefully or shutdown_abruptly are called.  | threaded: run server on its own thread if True        | None  |
| `set_fn_new_client()`       | Sets a callback function that will be called for every new `client` connecting to us  | function        | None  |
| `set_fn_client_left()`      | Sets a callback function that will be called for every `client` disconnecting from us | function        | None  |
| `set_fn_message_received()` | Sets a callback function that will be called when a `client` sends a message          | function        | None  |
| `send_message()`            | Sends a `message` to a specific `client`. The message is a simple string.             | client, message, args | None  |
| `send_message_to_all()`     | Sends a `message` to **all** connected clients. The message is a simple string.       | message         | None  |
| `disconnect_clients_gracefully()` | Disconnect all connected clients by sending a websocket CLOSE handshake.        | Optional: status, reason | None  |
| `disconnect_clients_abruptly()`   | Disconnect all connected clients. Clients won't be aware until they try to send some data. | None | None  |
| `shutdown_gracefully()`     | Disconnect clients with a CLOSE handshake and shutdown server. | Optional: status, reason      | None  |
| `shutdown_abruptly()`       | Disconnect clients and shutdown server with no handshake.      | None                          | None  |
| `deny_new_connections()`    | Close connection for new clients.                              | Optional: status, reason      | None  |
| `allow_new_connections()`   | Allows back connection for new clients.                        |                               | None  |


### Callback functions

| Set by                      | Description                                       | Parameters              |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| `set_fn_new_client()`       | Called for every new `client` connecting to us    | client, server          |
| `set_fn_client_left()`      | Called for every `client` disconnecting from us   | client, server          |
| `set_fn_message_received()` | Called when a `client` sends a `message`          | client, server, message |


The client passed to the callback is the client that left, sent the message, etc. The server might not have any use to use. However it is passed in case you want to send messages to clients.


Example:
````py
import logging
from websocket_server import WebsocketServer

def new_client(client, server):
	server.send_message_to_all("Hey all, a new client has joined us")

server = WebsocketServer(host='127.0.0.1', port=13254, loglevel=logging.INFO)
server.set_fn_new_client(new_client)
server.run_forever()
````  
Example (SSL):  
````py
import logging
from websocket_server import WebsocketServer

def new_client(client, server):
	server.send_message_to_all("Hey all, a new client has joined us")

server = WebsocketServer(host='127.0.0.1', port=13254, loglevel=logging.INFO, key="key.pem", cert="cert.pem")
server.set_fn_new_client(new_client)
server.run_forever()
````  

## Client

Client is just a dictionary passed along methods.

```py
{
	'id'      : client_id,
	'handler' : client_handler,
	'address' : (addr, port)
}
```
